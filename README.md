C语言学习
C is a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms and operating systems. C is an imperative language, with a small number of keywords and a large number of mathematical operators. C is also a very low level programming language, which means it can communicate directly with hardware.

in this repositories,I will show some code based on C language,including pointers,algorithm，data structure etc.
I am a C language beginners,I wish this could exercise my coding capacity.I would appreciate it if you could give me some advice.
